# Aim of the project: 

The main objective of this individual task is to gain knowledge in building parallel machine learning (ML) applications on the Amazon AWS cloud platform. The focus will be on acquiring three essential skills:
Utilizing Apache Spark to train ML models concurrently across multiple EC2 instances.
Implementing Spark's MLlib to develop and leverage ML models in the cloud environment.
Mastering Docker to create a container for the ML model, streamlining the process of model deployment.

# Creation of 4 Ec2 Instances for running the model

First I logged into the AWS console and went to the learners lab.
Then clicked on the the start lab button which started the lab.
Then once the green point was on clicked on the AWS tab and it took me to the AWS console.
Once I was at the AWS console I searched for EC2 instances and created 4 new instances
Named the instances as a1, a2, a3, a4.
Followed the same steps for the creation of EC2 instance which was done in Project 1.
But at the end I changed the IAM role from labrole to EMR role.
